## Olivia Rodrigo Artist Page
This project is the combined work of Matthew Freestone and Lorissa Algarin

Due to stuggles with React Native, we were not able to successfully create a frontend, so this isn't really a submission, but rather a log of what we did manage to finish

### Backend
On the backend, Matthew used express to make calls to a MongoDB Server that kept a record of tours. He also used express to make calls to the spotify api, as it proved difficult to do this from React. He successfully got a access token, but was unable to get it to the frontend (async functions are confusing when you've never used them before!)

### Frontend
Neither team member had any frontend experience, so we did little other than getting React Native set up with Expo, and a short attempt at implimenting the design. 

### Design
Lorissa created a design for the page using Figma. The concept art is in the root of this repo. She designed each of the large stickers to be a button that displays info about concerts that month while playing clips of Olivia Rodrigo's most popular songs. The stickers are high-resolution versions of the stickers on Olivia's face in the album's art.
